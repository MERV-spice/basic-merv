# Ahoy!

Ahoy! is an app that allows you to build and participate in treasure with your friends. When a you locate a clue, use the app to snap a picture; if it's a match you add coins to your treasure chest. Compare your scores to see whoâ€™s the sneakiest scalawag on the high seas!

## Getting Started:

To use Ahoy! from GitHub fork and clone the repository.
In order to run Ahoy! you will need to add a PostGIS extension to PostGreSQL. This extension adds support for geographic objects, allowing location queries to be run in SQL.

Once you have added the PostGIS extension, npm i. You can also npm run seed to populate the database, or add users and games yourself using the sign up and make game functionality in the app!
